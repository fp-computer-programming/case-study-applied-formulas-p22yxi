### Applied Formulas
---

Answer each of the following questions in a separate Python file named `cs1-#.py` where `#` is the number of the question. In your heading, put your name and the date you began working on the file. 

1. The distance between two points is calculated from the square root of the sum of the squared difference of each coordinate:

   ![distance_formula](https://i.imgur.com/LiWLpDJ.png)

   Write a program that prompts the user for the x coordinate and y coordinate for 2 points. The program should then calculate the distance between the two points and print this value.

2. The formula for compound interest is:

    ![compound_interest_formula](https://i.imgur.com/j5VhYKa.png)

    Where:

    `A` = the future value of the investment

    `P` = the principal investment (the initial deposit amount)

    `r` = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)

    `n` = the number of times that interest is compounded per unit `t`

    `t` = the amount of time the money is invested


    Write a program that prompts the user to enter an investment amount, annual interest rate as a percent, and number of years that the money is in the account. The program should then calculate the value of the account at this future date. Assume interest is compounded monthly. Don't worry about the result printing with more than 2 decimal places.
